_There are three types of variables in Solidity_

1. Local: Declared inside a function and not stored on the chain
2. State: Declared outside a function to maintain global state within the contract
3. Global: Provides information about the chain. Injected by EVM during runtime and are not declared by the contract author

_Components of Solidity_

Keywords::
* Contract
* Library
* Pragma
* Modifier

_Identifiers::_
Identifiers are unique names given to entities such as variables, functions, contracts and other user-defined items
Identifiers help in uniquely naming and accessing these entities within the scope of the program

_Rules for Identifiers:_
1. Alphabet and digits: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _
2. Start with letter or underscore
3. Case sensitive
4. No reserved keywords

_Literals_
Literals is a data type which you define in your smart contracts
Literals are fixed values directly written into code
These are constat values and are not represented by variables or expressions
